# PyTorch-practices
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly PyTorch exercises to help understand the core concepts of deep learning using PyTorch. It includes simple mini-projects based on PyTorch fundamentals, inspired by resources like `yunjey’s PyTorch Tutorial`
 and the `Official PyTorch 60-Minute Blitz`.

> **Note**: The examples are compatible with PyTorch 0.4.0 and above.

## Contents
#### 1. Basics
- [MNIST Classification](mnist)
- [Visualizing Model and Logs](visualizing_model_&_logs)
- [Simple LSTM](simple-LSTM)

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.5 or newer version. Installing the requirements are as follow:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started
Since dataset is downloaded and preprocessed automatically in the runtime simply running below start training.
```shell
python train.py
```
Input arguments are vary among the codes, so please check the `train.py` for more details.
